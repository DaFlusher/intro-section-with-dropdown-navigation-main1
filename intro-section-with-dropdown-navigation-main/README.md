## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://reactjs.org/) - CSS and JS library


### What I learned
I have definitely come a long way this past week. From learning sass to learning how to customize bootstrap styles using sass. Since, this challenge did not require much custom styles, I used plain css.

```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 ul a .custom-list-one::before{
      content: url('/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-main/images/icon-todo.svg');
      margin-right: 0.5rem;
  }



### Continued development

I had a quite a hardtime merging responsive navigation with the bootstrap offcanvas. Since the default bootstrap navigation is quite different from that used in the challenge.


### Useful resources

- [ resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - Always my go to site when in doubt.
- [resource 2](https://www.openai.com) - I began using chatgpt3.5(the free version) quite recently following a youtube tutorial on prompt engineering offered via codecamp. It was quite useful in troubleshooting.
